1) LOGIN - click on 'Login' and then 'Register.'
2) Provide a 'username' and 'password.' You can use 'admin' username and
'admin' password which provides access to the database through the admin
panel.
3) ADD A NEW RESTAURANT - a new restaurant has to be added to be
used for a burger location. A restaurant's name, description, photo,
address, city and postcode can be provided. Furthermore, the map can
be used. The pointer provides the exact address of a location which
can then be used to fill in the text fields. The address appears below
the map. Finally, click 'Add Place.'
4) POST NEW BURGER - choose a burger name, category, location and 
photo. Locations that have been specified in step 3 will appear on
the map. Clicking on 'Add It Now!' below the Location combo box will
redirect the user to step 3. Click 'Add Burger.'
5) BURGER SURF - now that a burger is added it will appear in this 
section of the app. You will be redirected here directly from step

showing all of the details of the concrete burger - the place where
it can be eaten, the address of the restaurant, the comments given
for this burger and the rate of it.

a number from 1 to 5 to rate the burger (1 being the lowest). Add an
additional image of the burger if you have tasted it as well. Click
'Submit Review' and your comment will appear with your name next to it.
The rating is used to choose the Burger King. Refreshing the page

Month which will depend on the user rating. It will also show the place at
which it can be found. This page will also present the most recent comments
